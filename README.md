## FPGA-based-Tone-Encoder-for-a-Ground-Telecommand-System-
A 3 tones, 2 commands FPGA-type tone encoder used in a telecommand system is a digital circuit implemented on an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) that is responsible for encoding two specific commands into three distinct audio tones. It converts the input commands into tone sequences that can be transmitted and decoded by the GTC.

# Ground Telecommand System 
Ground Tele-Command system has a significant role in the dynamic testing of flight vehicles especially missiles. It is a range safety tool for every missile testing range in the world. When the flight vehicle under test, deviates from its desired trajectory and crosses the safety zone then the TC system is used to terminate the vehicle to safeguard human lives and property. 
Here are some key reasons for the need for a ground TC system:
●	Remote Operations

●	Real-time Responsiveness

●	Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness

●	Scalability and Flexibility

●	Training and Simulation

In the dynamic testing of flight vehicles, a ground telecommand system plays a crucial role in controlling and monitoring various aspects of the testing process. It serves as a communication link between the ground-based operators and the flight vehicle, allowing for real-time command and control during dynamic testing scenarios. 
# A.	Ground Control Station (GCS):
It includes computer systems, displays, communication interfaces, and specialized software for telecommand operations.

# B.	Communication Links:
Based on various technologies such as radio frequency (RF), satellite communication, or optical communication between the GCS and flight vehicles. 
Apart from these, there are various other components like the Telecommand Encoder, Telemetry Receiver, Telecommand Receiver, and Command Decoder/Processor. 
The overall configuration of the GTC is shown below :

From the figure it is clear that the system is a redundant hot-swappable system, each chain consists of a Digital Encoder, Modulator, Power Amplifier, and antennae with Command Console & Switch-Over Units in common between the two chains. Command Console insists the command to be transmitted and depending upon the command received the Digital Encoder generates a binary FSK modulated signal which is then fed to the Modulator for FM modulation. This signal is then power amplified and transmitted through omnidirectional or directional antennae depending upon the requirement. 

TC system generates four types of commands and transmits these commands on demand through a UHF link.
•	 SAFE command is transmitted normally which ensures the link between the ground TC system and missile onboard receiver. 
•	When termination is required then a sequence of commands like ARM, TT, and DESTRUCT are transmitted. These commands are received and decoded by the on-board receiver decoder and passed to the destruction system. ARM command allows activation of TT, TT command is used to cut off the thrust of liquid propellant and DEST command enables destruction system for termination. TT command is not required in case there is no liquid propellant. Full redundancy is incorporated on the ground as well as on the flight vehicle to cater to reliable operation under the worst conditions.

The Ground TC system is a dual-chain transmitting system with an Automatic change-over unit. Each transmitter chains consist of a command encoder interfaced with a Remote Command Panel (RCP), an FM modulator, and a High-power UHF amplifier. The function of the cache unit has been described below: 

1.	RSO PANEL: It is used for issuing required commands by the competent authority. This unit is interfaced in parallel with both the Command Encoders through copper cable or via an RS-232 communication interface.
2.	COMMAND ENCODER: These units are the baseband units. They are again of several types. Currently, there are two types of Encoder systems. (a) The Tone-based Encoder (IRIG-313). (b) Digital Encoder System. Tone Encoders are used from the beginning of the missile program. These Encoders generate different mixed IRIG (Inter-Range Instrumentation Group) tone outputs as decided when configuring the system for the direct commands. However, nowadays most missiles use a Digital Telecommand System with a Command Encoder. 
3.	FM MODULATOR: This unit is used for Frequency Modulation of the baseband signals from the Encoder system at the desired carrier frequency in the UHF band.
4.	POWER AMPLIFIER: The High-Power Amplifier is solid-state, reliable, and cool running, allowing max continuous 1- kW output power at ambient temperatures from 10° C to 40° C. The System is MIL-STD-9858A qualified and designed to military standards for high MTBF.
5.	ANTENNA: Used to radiate the modulated command signal in the air. Usually, Omnidirectional antennas with RH circular polarization are used so that in the worst case, even if the missile deviates much beyond its expected trajectory, the missile must be able to receive commands. 

6.	AUTO CHANGE OVER UNIT: This unit carries out the function of the centralized monitoring and control of the entire system. It continuously monitors the health of both the Transmitter chains and the antennas Forward power level, Reflected power level, VSWR fault, over temperature fault, status of all the power amplifier modules of the transmitter, etc. In case any of the transmitter chains is found to be faulty, it changes over to the backup chain. Similarly, if any of the antennas is found to be faulty, it changes over to the secondary antenna.
7.	DUMMY LOAD OR TERMINATOR: The output of the transmitter can be fed to a Dummy load instead of an antenna if required for some tests & measurements. Also, when any one of the transmitters is selected for transmission through any one of the two antennas the other transmitter (even if powered off) is automatically terminated to dummy load for safety. Again, in case both the antennas fail, then both the transmitters are terminated to dummy load.

# Components of Telecommand System in ITR :

•	Command Centre: The command center serves as the control hub of the telecommand system. It consists of workstations, consoles, and communication equipment where operators or commanders issue commands and monitor the telecommand operations. The command center interfaces with various subsystems to send and receive command signals.
•	Command Encoder: The command encoder is responsible for encoding high-level commands or instructions into a suitable format for transmission. It takes the commands from the command center and converts them into specific signals, tones, or digital codes that can be transmitted over the communication channel.
•	Transmitter: The transmitter is the component that transmits the encoded command signals over the communication channel. It may utilize various communication technologies such as radio frequency (RF) transmission, satellite communication, or other wireless or wired communication mediums.               
•	Receiver: The receiver is responsible for receiving the transmitted command signals. It may include antennas, receivers, and demodulators to capture and extract the command signals from the communication channel.
•	Decoder: The decoder processes the received command signals and converts them back into meaningful commands or instructions. It interprets the encoded signals and provides the appropriate outputs for further action or execution.
•	Data Processing and Control Units: These units handle data processing, command validation, and coordination of telecommand operations. They may include microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), or specialized processing units to execute command logic, perform error checking, and manage overall system operations.
•	Telemetry and Communication Subsystems: These subsystems enable bidirectional communication between the telecommand system, and the platforms or devices being controlled. They allow for the transmission of telemetry data, status updates, and acknowledgment signals between the command center and the remote devices.
•	Power and Signal Conditioning Units: These units provide the necessary power supply and conditioning for the telecommand system components. They may include power management systems, voltage regulators, and signal conditioning circuits to ensure proper operation of the system.

## Architecture of FPGA :

The architecture of an FPGA consists of several key components, including Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs), interconnects, I/O pads, and a switching matrix. Here is a brief explanation of each component:
# 1. Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs):
They consist of a collection of Look-Up Tables (LUTs), registers, multiplexers, and other logic elements. LUTs are programmable lookup tables that allow users to define the desired logic function within the CLB. The outputs of the LUTs can be routed to various destinations within the FPGA.

# 2. Interconnects:
Interconnects form the network of programmable connections within an FPGA, allowing the flow of signals between different components. They consist of a series of routing channels that run horizontally and vertically across the FPGA fabric. Interconnects provide the necessary paths for connecting the inputs and outputs of CLBs, as well as other components such as memory blocks and specialized functional units.

# 3. I/O Pads:
These pads act as the connection points for input and output signals, allowing communication between the FPGA and other devices. I/O pads typically support a variety of electrical standards, such as LVCMOS, LVDS, and differential signaling. They also provide features like voltage level translation, impedance matching, and protection circuitry.

# 4. Switching Matrix:
The switching matrix is responsible for establishing the connections between the input and output signals within an FPGA. It consists of a matrix of programmable switches that can be dynamically configured to establish the desired connections. The switching matrix enables the routing of signals from one CLB to another, allowing for the interconnection of various logic elements and the creation of complex digital circuits.
