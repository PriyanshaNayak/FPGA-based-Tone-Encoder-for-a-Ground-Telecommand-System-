# FPGA-based-Tone-Encoder-for-a-Ground-Telecommand-System-
A 3 tones, 2 commands FPGA-type tone encoder used in a telecommand system is a digital circuit implemented on an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) that is responsible for encoding two specific commands into three distinct audio tones. It converts the input commands into tone sequences that can be transmitted and decoded by the GTC.
